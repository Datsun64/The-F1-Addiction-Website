<p>Carlos Sainz hopes to take a win in his home Spanish Grand Prix, after Ferrari has managed to give him a competitive car. The stakes are even higher, since he will be racing in front of his fellow countrymen and women! Charles Leclerc, despite having multiple wins with Ferrari, still has to win at his home Gran Prix of Monaco, having been cursed with DNFs and a DNS last year. Carlos will need a lot of commitment and focus, since Charles and Max are also very hungry for victories, the latter even more since he wants to close the gap between himself and Charles for the contention of the Drivers Wold Championship.</p>

<p>Max Vertsappen snatches victory away from Pole Sitter Charles Leclerc after starting in p3 and lauching the car fast enough to overtake Carlos Sainz in the first corner! The podium is then completed by the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz respectively. Sergio Perez managed to complete his race in p4, despite having a sudden power loss midway through the race while almost overtaking Sainz. A good race from the duo Mercedes George Russell and Lewis Hamilton both finishing p5 and p6, after struggling in the previous races for double point finishes. Valtteri Bottas is the sole Alfa Romeo Driver to bring the car into the points, but he could have been ahead of both Mercedes cars if he didn't send his car too deep into Turn 17. Farnatsic recovery from Esteban ocon, who manages to pring his car p8 after starting last in p20! A criminally underrated performance that truly went under the radar of a lot of people. Fantastic race from both alex Albon and Lance Stroll who managed to bring their Williams and Aston martin respectively in the last position of achievable points.</p>
